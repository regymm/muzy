# muzy
2-layer FPGA development board with ZYNQ 7010/7020 400-pin BGA.  
Pad size was shrinked due to clearance requirements. 

## Working

PL JTAG & bitstream downloading, 640x480 VGA, BTN/LED, All GPIO pins

## Untested

PS, SD Card, PL UART, SDRAM

## Not Working

JTAG at 30 MHz seems not stable
